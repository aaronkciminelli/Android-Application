**Screens and Features**

To support user needs and create a user-centered UI, the Event Tracking app includes the following screens and features:

* **Login Screen:** This screen allows users to create a new account or log in to an existing account. The login screen should be user-friendly, intuitive, and include security measures such as password requirements to protect user information.
* **Calendar View:** The calendar view displays upcoming events in a monthly, weekly, or daily format. It should be customizable with color-coded labels for different event types, such as work-related events, personal events, or appointments. Users should be able to add, edit, and remove events directly from the calendar view.
* **List View:** The list view displays upcoming events in a chronological order. It should include the event's name, date, time, and location. Users should be able to filter events by category, such as work or personal events.
* **Notification System:** The notification system should alert users when an event is approaching. Users should be able to customize the notification settings, such as the time of the notification and the type of notification, such as a pop-up or a sound.
* **Event Management:** The event management system allows users to add, edit, and remove events. It should be intuitive and easy to use.
* **User Management:** The user management system allows users to create and manage their accounts. It should include security measures such as password requirements to protect user information.

**User-Centered UI Design**

To create a user-centered UI, the design should be intuitive, easy to use, and visually appealing. Users should be able to navigate the app with ease and find the information they need quickly. The UI design should be consistent throughout the app to create a cohesive user experience.

The design should also take into consideration the user's preferences and needs. For example, users should be able to customize the app's color scheme or choose a preferred view, such as the monthly or weekly view. The app should also be accessible to users with disabilities, such as those who use screen readers or have visual impairments.

**User Testing**

To ensure that the UI design was successful, user testing was conducted to gather feedback on the app's usability and functionality. User feedback was used to make changes to the UI design to improve the user experience.

**Coding Approach**

The approach to coding the app involved several techniques and strategies to ensure the app was functional and efficient. The first step was to develop a database with at least two tables, one for user management and another for event management.

Next, the app's user interface was created using Android Studio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development. The UI design was created using XML layouts, which allowed for the creation of responsive and dynamic UI elements.

To ensure that the app was functional, several programming languages were used, including Java and SQL. Java was used to write the app's logic, while SQL was used to interact with the app's database.

Testing was conducted throughout the coding process to ensure that the app was functional and free of errors. This involved unit testing, which tests individual units of code, and integration testing, which tests how the different units of code work together.

**Testing Process**

The testing process was essential to ensure that the app was functional and free of errors. It revealed several issues that needed to be addressed, such as:

* A bug in the login screen that prevented users from logging in.
* A bug in the calendar view that caused the app to crash.
* A bug in the notification system that prevented users from receiving notifications.


**Conclusion**



The Event Tracking app is a user-friendly and efficient app that helps users track their events. The app was created using a user-centered approach and was thoroughly tested to ensure its quality.
